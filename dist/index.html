        According to the legendary Historia Regum Britanniae, by Geoffrey of
        Monmouth, London was founded by Brutus of Troy about 1000â€“1100 B.C.
        after he defeated the native giant Gogmagog; the settlement was known as
        Caer Troia, Troia Nova (Latin for New Troy), which, according to a
        pseudo-etymology, was corrupted to Trinovantum. Trinovantes were the
        Iron Age tribe who inhabited the area prior to the Romans. Geoffrey
        provides prehistoric London with a rich array of legendary kings, such
        as Lud (see also Lludd, from Welsh mythology) who, he claims, renamed
        the town Caer Ludein, from which London was derived, and was buried at
        Ludgate.

        Londinium was established as a civilian town by the Romans about four
        years[8] after the invasion of AD 43. London, like Rome, was founded on
        the point of the river where it was narrow enough to bridge and the
        strategic location of the city provided easy access to much of Europe.
        Early Roman London occupied a relatively small area, roughly equivalent
        to the size of Hyde Park. In around AD 60, it was destroyed by the Iceni
        led by their queen Boudica. The city was quickly rebuilt as a planned
        Roman town and recovered after perhaps 10 years, the city growing
        rapidly over the following decades. During the 2nd century Londinium was
        at its height and replaced Colchester as the capital of Roman Britain
        (Britannia). Its population was around 60,000 inhabitants. It boasted
        major public buildings, including the largest basilica north of the
        Alps, temples, bath houses, an amphitheatre and a large fort for the
        city garrison. Political instability and recession from the 3rd century
        onwards led to a slow decline. At some time between AD 180 and AD 225,
        the Romans built the defensive London Wall around the landward side of
        the city. The wall was about 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) long, 6 metres (20
        ft) high, and 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) thick. The wall would survive for
        another 1,600 years and define the City of London's perimeters for
        centuries to come. The perimeters of the present City are roughly
        defined by the line of the ancient wall. Londonium was an ethnically
        diverse city with inhabitants from across the Roman Empire, including
        natives of Britannia, continental Europe, the Middle East, and North
        Africa.[9] In the late 3rd century, Londinium was raided on several
        occasions by Saxon pirates.[citation needed] This led, from around 255
        onwards, to the construction of an additional riverside wall. Six of the
        traditional seven city gates of London are of Roman origin, namely:
        Ludgate, Newgate, Aldersgate, Cripplegate, Bishopsgate and Aldgate
        (Moorgate is the exception, being of medieval origin). By the 5th
        century, the Roman Empire was in rapid decline and in AD 410, the Roman
        occupation of Britannia came to an end. Following this, the Roman city
        also went into rapid decline and by the end of the 5th century was
        practically abandoned.

        The 18th century was a period of rapid growth for London, reflecting an
        increasing national population, the early stirrings of the Industrial
        Revolution, and London's role at the centre of the evolving British
        Empire.

        In 1707, an Act of Union was passed merging the Scottish and the English
        Parliaments, thus establishing the Kingdom of Great Britain. A year
        later, in 1708 Christopher Wren's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral was
        completed on his birthday.

        However, the first service had been held on 2 December 1697; more than
        10 years earlier. This Cathedral replaced the original St. Paul's which
        had been completely destroyed in the Great Fire of London. This building
        is considered one of the finest in Britain and a fine example of Baroque
        architecture.
